# Spaceship
This is a highschool project.
I decided to upload this to Github and maybe other things, hopefully

I took a random license because apparently no license won't let someone use this code

This project is a little video game made on Pygame, as I was tasked.
The directives were : "Make a video game with a spaceship in space" ; "Use Pygame" ; "Use inertial movement for your spaceship"

The rest was my addition. This was my first actual project, teaching me organisation, project mindset, and most importantly the fact that I will probably not like being a programmer/software engineer as I won't have the time to perfect my project and add things I would like, if I even have the choice of that project.

Ain't no way I translate every comment to english

If anybody ever runs into this :
# Instructions to run it
- Download everything and put it in a folder somewhere. *Do not modify the layout of the project nor change any names !*
- Make sure you got every library needed. You probably only need to download Pygame through ```pip install pygame``` on cmd
- Run main.py, through your IDE or just ```python main.py``` on shell (make sure you opened it in your folder, shift+right click --> open powershell window here
- enjoy

If it's laggy, decrease the numbers of stars by reducing the number range of possible stars in ```genStars()``` in main.py

I haven't figured out how to put everything in a single .exe , I tried Pyinstaller without success. If anybody knows let me know
